//why Async??
//Async because it will wait for some asynchronous operation like fetching data or loading assets

//Await new promise????
//basically we create a new promise which is also aysnc and then await it for the time specified
//This simulates a delay â€” like waiting for something to load API call, fonts, images, etc.
//remeber------this is not an actual logic ???
